# FlashDev 🚀  

**FlashDev** is an open-source project designed to detect **flash crypto transactions** in blockchain networks.  
Flash transactions are ultra-fast, often high-volume transactions that can sometimes be linked to arbitrage, market manipulation, or malicious activity. FlashDev helps in identifying and flagging these events for monitoring, research, or security purposes.  

---

## ✨ Features
- Detects unusually fast crypto transactions on the blockchain.  
- Flags suspicious patterns for further investigation.  
- Lightweight and easy-to-use for developers and researchers.  
- Open-source and community-driven.  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python** (core detection logic)  
- **Web3.py** for blockchain interaction  
- **Pandas/Numpy** for data handling and analysis  
- **CLI Interface** for running detection scripts
